# worm-mark-3
I little joking program made by me when I was in high school, i didn't have a better name so i put Worm - Mark 3 because i like Iron Man's suits naming and is my third version of this program :D.

If you just want to use the program and don't care about code, just go to /bin/Debug/ and pick the .exe file.
